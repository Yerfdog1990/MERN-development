/*
Count the Zeros

Given an array arr of only 0's and 1's. The array is sorted in such a manner that all the 1's are placed first and then they are followed by all the 0's. Find the count of all the 0's.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]
Output: 3
Explanation: There are 3 0's in the given array.
Input: arr[] = [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
Output: 5
Explanation: There are 5 0's in the array.
Constraints:
1 <= arr.size <= 105
0 <= arr[i] <= 1

Expected Complexities
Time Complexity: O(1)
Auxiliary Space: O(1)
